Big O - worst-case scenario
3n^2 + n + 3 + 1
3n^2 is worst-case scenario

Nested for loops aren't ideal

Logarithmic runtime examples: binary search trees

Array: indexed list of values stored in a continuous block of memory
Adding/deleting an item from an array is an example of a linear runtime (O(n)), don't have memory available, we'd have to copy it
Accessing an element from an array is an example of a constant runtime

Python is written in C 

Linked list is composed of many nodes. Nodes are composed of a value and a pointer to next node in list
- Linked lists don't need to be contiguous
- Inserting new head is fast: created new node, it's the new head, constant runtime
- Deleting head is similar
- Searching for a node takes a long time, as there is no order requirement, a linear search
- Check if is tail by seeing if pointer points to None
